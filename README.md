ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Cloud Drive is a web-based cloud storage application that allows users to register, log in, and access their home dashboard.

With the latest update, the Navbar has been integrated for easy navigation, so you no longer need to manually enter URLs to access different pages. Simply use the provided buttons in the Navbar to navigate through:

User Registration: Create a new account.

User Login: Access your secure dashboard.

Home Dashboard: Manage your cloud storage directly.

With the introduction of a navbar, you can now seamlessly navigate between these pages with a single click.

Navigation
Navbar Integration:
The updated UI includes a responsive navigation bar with dedicated buttons for:

Registration

Login

Home

This enhancement streamlines user access to the primary pages without needing to use the direct URLs.

Direct URL Access (for development purposes):

User Registration: http://localhost:3000/user/register

User Login: http://localhost:3000/user/login

Home: http://localhost:3000/home

Local Development
To run the application locally:

Clone the repository.

Install the necessary dependencies.

Start the development server, and then visit http://localhost:3000.

The new navbar will be available once the server is running, offering an easier way to navigate between the various sections of the application.

Work In Progress
Please note that Cloud Drive is in the initial stage of development, and new features are actively being added. Your feedback is welcome to help improve the application.
